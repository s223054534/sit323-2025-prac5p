SIT323/737 - Practical 5.1P: Containerisation of a Simple Web Application

This repository contains a simple "Hello World! It's Manya!!" Node.js web application which I containerised using Docker and Docker Compose.

First I installed:
- Docker 
- Docker Compose
- Git

Then I cloned the repository. I then created a docker file and built a docker image. Then created a docker compose file started the environment and then tested and pushed the app in github.
